Welcome to\n\
Super 2uigi 62!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
This hack was made for\n\
the SimpleFlips\n\
March 2024\n\
Slide-Hack Competition,\n\
\
sponsored by\n\
PirateSoftware!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
This is my first hack!\n\
and also my first time\n\
making a game at all.\n\
\n\
\
I had a lot of fun\n\
making it and\n\
I hope you enjoy\n\
playing it!\n\
\
Hack Made by\n\
ArcaneArboretum\n\
with advice from the\n\
romhacking.com discord.\n\
\
Textures for the hack\n\
were provided by\n\

Hey 2uigi!\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
Yeah, you heard me right!\n\
'2uigi', as in, Luigi 2.\n\
I figured you'd be a\n\
little confused by that,\n\
so I told E.Gadd I'd\n\
wait for you out here.\n\
\
The real Luigi went\n\
into that mansion\n\
a couple hours ago\n\
with the Poltergust 3000\n\
and hasn't come back.\n\
\n\
\
E.Gadd created you as\n\
a clone from Luigi's\n\
DNA so you could go\n\
in there and\n\
find his Poltergust...\n\
\n\
\
I mean...\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
...make sure Luigi's okay.\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
Unforunately, your DNA\n\
got mixed a bit with\n\
some ghost genes, so\n\
you might find that\n\
you're a bit out of\n\
phase.\n\
\
Maybe E.Gadd\n\
should've named you\n\
'Booigi'!\n\
Heh, heh ...\n\
\n\
... Heh.\n\
\
Yeah, he told me that\n\
name was lame...\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
... Forget I said\n\
anything...\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
... Anyways ...\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
If you need some time\n\
to get used to your new\n\
self, why don't you head\n\
on into the lab behind\n\
me and figure those new\n\
skills of yours out first.\n\
\
Then, head to the mansion\n\
and recover the poltergust!\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\
\
I mean...\n\
\n\
\n\
\n\

There are 4 stars in this\n\
hack, one at the end of\n\

There are no\n\
100 coin stars.\n\

The red coin stars\n\

are playing on a\n\
