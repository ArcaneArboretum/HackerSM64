Welcome to\n\
Super 2uigi 62!\n\
\n\
\n\

This hack was made for\n\
the SimpleFlips\n\
March 2024\n\
Slide-Hack Competition,\n\
\
sponsored by\n\
PirateSoftware!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
This is my first hack!\n\
So if there's any weird\n\
issues, that's probably\n\
why.\n\

Hack Made by\n\

with advice from\n\

were provided by\n\

Hey 2uigi!\n\
Confused?\n\
You ought to be.\n\
\n\

\n\
\
The real Luigi went\n\
into that mansion\n\
a couple hours ago\n\
with my Poltergust 2000\n\
and hasn't come back.\n\
\n\
\
I created you as a clone\n\
from Luigi's DNA so you\n\
could go in there and\n\
find my Poltergust...\n\
\n\
\n\

I mean...\n\

You didn't quite have\n\
time to finish baking\n\
so to speak, so you\n\
might find yourself\n\
a little gooey still.\n\
Heh, heh.\n\
\
I also made a couple\n\
'improvements' over the\n\
original model,\n\
if I do say so myself.\n\
\n\
\n\
\
If you need some time\n\
to get used to your new\n\
self, why don't you head\n\
on into my lab behind\n\
me and figure those new\n\
skills of yours out first.\n\
\
Then, head to the mansion\n\
and recover my poltergust!\n\

First things first,\n\
since you didn't get\n\
to spend a full cycle\n\
in the clone machine,\n\
you're still a bit gooey.\n\

This makes you perfect\n\
for fitting through\n\
grates like the one\n\
in front of you.\n\

Just press L to go gooey,\n\

Next, I'll teach you\n\
one of those\n\
'improvements' I\n\
mentioned.\n\
\n\
\
Press [A] when\n\
ground-pounding to\n\
perform a Spin-Jump!\n\
You gain lots of height\n\
and start to twirl!\n\
\
Hold [A] while twirling\n\
to spin faster and\n\
travel further before\n\
landing.\n\
\n\
\
Hold [Z] while twirling\n\
to activate your\n\
Spin-Drill!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
You'll drill straight\n\
down and destroy\n\
anything you land on!\n\
Spindurful!\n\
\n\
\
Use the Spin-Jump and\n\
Drill in tandem\n\
to navigate precision\n\
platforms with ease!\n\
\n\
\
Oh, and don't forget\n\
you can go gooey while\n\
twirling too!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
You won't be able to\n\
start a spin jump on\n\
a slippery surface,\n\
though. So find some\n\
flat ground first!\n\

I'll see you at the next\n\
training area when\n\
you're ready.\n\

gap with a good spin!"))

Alrighty, time I shared\n\
the last of your\n\
'improvements' 2uigi!\n\
You might have figured\n\
one of them out already.\n\
\
First, have you noticed\n\
you don't take any\n\
damage when falling\n\
from extreme heights?\n\
\n\
\
You can thank your\n\
gooey self for that!\n\
There's another thing\n\
you can thank to your\n\
gooey shape.\n\
\
Press [B] while still\n\
in the air after ground-\n\
pounding and you'll\n\
spring out in whatever\n\
direction you hold.\n\
\
Use this technique\n\
to reach new distances\n\
and traverse corners\n\
with your jumps!\n\
\n\
\
You can completely\n\
change your direction\n\
in-air with this ability,\n\
so look out for places\n\
it might be useful!\n\
\
Lastly, you might have\n\
noticed that you can\n\
ground-pound after a\n\
long jump now too!\n\

You'll need this to\n\
make it to the final\n\
chamber!\n\

You'll need it."))
