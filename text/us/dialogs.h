Welcome to\n\
Super 2uigi 62!\n\
\n\
\n\

This hack was made for\n\
the SimpleFlips\n\
March 2024\n\
Slide-Hack Competition,\n\
\
sponsored by\n\
PirateSoftware!\n\
\n\
\n\
\
This is my first hack!\n\
It's also my first time\n\
making a game at all.\n\
\n\
\
I had a lot of fun\n\
making it and\n\
I hope you enjoy\n\
playing it!\n\
\
Hack Made by\n\
ArcaneArboretum\n\
with advice from the\n\
romhacking discord.\n\
\
Textures for the hack\n\
were provided by\n\
MrGreenThunder\n\
on SMWCentral.net."))

Hey 2uigi!\n\
Confused?\n\
I figured you\n\
would be.\n\
\n\
\n\
\
The real Luigi went\n\
into that mansion\n\
a couple hours ago\n\
with my Poltergust 3000\n\
and hasn't come back.\n\
\n\
\
I created you as a clone\n\
from Luigi's DNA so you\n\
could go in there and\n\
find my Poltergust...\n\
\n\
\n\
\
I mean...\n\
\n\

You didn't quite have\n\
time to finish baking\n\
so to speak, so you\n\
might find yourself\n\
a little gooey still.\n\
Heh, heh.\n\
\
I also made a couple\n\
'improvements' over the\n\
original model,\n\
if I do say so myself.\n\
\n\
\n\
\
If you need some time\n\
to get used to your new\n\
self, why don't you head\n\
on into my lab behind\n\
me and figure those new\n\
skills of yours out first.\n\
\
Then, head to the mansion\n\
and recover my poltergust!\n\

There are 5 stars in this\n\
hack, one at the end of\n\
each of 2 slide areas, \n\
and one for getting\n\
6 out of 8 red coins\n\
on each slide.\n\
\
There is also a\n\
100 coin star\n\
in the main hub area, \n\
but not in any\n\
of the slides.\n\

You might need to learn\n\
a few new moves from\n\

are a bit tougher than\n\

are playing on a\n\
\
time limit (such as\n\
for the Romhacking.com\n\
Slide Hack Competition),\n\
I recommend just going\n\
for the regular stars\n\

Alrighty, time I shared\n\
